The development of several classifiers was requested as an assignment at my university.
The use of Sckit Learn was not allowed for this task, with some exceptions.
The aim of this assignment is to understand how a classifier works internally and achieve similar results to those achieved in commercial settings.

1 Categorical Naive Bayes Classifier with smoothing and logistic probabilities

2 Binary Linear Classifier with logistic regression and gradient descent.

3 Multiclass Classifier.

All the classifiers are displayed together in "clasificadores.py" with some use examples
